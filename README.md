# Hand Tremor Assist Spoon & Brush

An assistive device that stabilizes a spoon/brush in real time to reduce hand tremors in people with Parkinson's disease.


## 🧠 Problem Statement

People with Parkinson's disease or essential tremors often struggle with simple daily activities like eating or brushing because of involuntary hand movements. This reduces independence and affects quality of life.
This project aims to provide a **low-cost assistive device** that helps reduce the impact of tremors on commonly used utensils.


## 🎯 What This Project Does

- Detects hand movement using motion sensors.
- Identifies tremor-like, involuntary motions.
- Actively stabilizes a spoon/brush using a controlled mechanism.
- Helps the user keep the utensil more stable during use.


## 🛠 Hardware & Tech Overview

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano
- **Sensors:** Accelerometer + gyroscope (MPU6050)  
- **Actuators:** Servo motor 
- **Power:** USB  
- **Use Case:** Spoon and brush attachments for eating and personal care
